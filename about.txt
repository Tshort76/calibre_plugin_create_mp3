The Create MP3 Plugin
===========================
Created by Thomas Long
Requires calibre >= 8.0.0
===========================
This plugin allows the user to easily pass a book's meta and file_path to a script.
There is the assumption that the script is capable of converting EPUB, PDF, or TXT files to audio files.

If you do not have a way to do this (e.g. call an LLM with an API Key), you can use the https://github.com/Tshort76/echo 
library, which leverages edge-tts under the hood for text-to-speech (and has some data cleaning logic to improve the read out).

I assume that the script takes at least an absolute filepath to the book, :BOOK:
Optionally, you can also use the :META: placeholder to pass the ebook's meta data to your script
